# refugee-analysis

This repository contains the data and code for an AIT 2016 Spring Data Mining project focusing on applying predictive analytics to refugee data.  
We have three goals:
- Predict when countries will produce refugees 
- Predict where refugees will go
- Predict what kind of people become refugees
Our intent is to see if countries can better anticipate mass migration scenarios, and as a result, better prepare for such incidents, allowing more refugees to have a better experience in such incidents.
